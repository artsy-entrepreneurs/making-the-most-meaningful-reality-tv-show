# Making The Most Meaningful Reality TV Show

We are TEAM (( COME UP WITH A COOL NAME LATER )). _Our mission is to create the most meaningful Reality TV Show_. And get it distributed on an awesome streaming platform. Doing these things will not be easy. We do not know at this point (November 10, 2020) what the show will look like, or how we will make it.

But we have a sense of what will _drive_ the show â€”

Think (:heart:) desire of future filmmaking (:heart:) love of screenplay writing (:heart:) desire to learn about urban, suburban, and rural america (:heart:) need for self-discipline (:heart:) individualism and family love (:heart:) appreciation of art and entrepreneurship (:heart:) compassionate capitalism (:heart:) strengths of america and india (:heart:) appreciation of hindu dharma (:heart:) curiosity about church communities (:heart:) mantra of vasudhaiva kutumbakam (:heart:) love of coding and team building (:heart:) hard work and house parties (:heart:) hitchhiking and travel (:heart:) and more (:heart:).

In our show we will â€”

- _build a small team; of young millennials and gen-z folks_
- _build a small business; that is simple, audaciuos, and awesome_

(( TODO we do not know how we will do that either ... but time has come for ))

- _Us young millennials and gen-z folks must rise to today's challenges._ 
- _Just like the great generations before us had to._ 
- _. . . But differently._

ðŸ¦‡ global pandemic ðŸ¦‡ unhealthy globalism ðŸ¦‡ fake news ðŸ¦‡ racial riots ðŸ¦‡ religious riots ðŸ¦‡ job losses ðŸ¦‡ urban divide ðŸ¦‡ rural divide ðŸ¦‡ addictive tech ðŸ¦‡ addictive porn ðŸ¦‡ lockdowns ðŸ¦‡ loneliness ðŸ¦‡ depression ðŸ¦‡ and more. Oh dear God, it will not be easy to overcome how the decade 2020 has started.

But these problems must be sovled, solved quick, and balance restored.
