# Making The Most Meaningful Reality TV Show

ğŸ¦‡ global pandemic ğŸ¦‡ unhealthy globalism ğŸ¦‡ fake news ğŸ¦‡ racial riots ğŸ¦‡ religious riots ğŸ¦‡ urban rural divide ğŸ¦‡ job loss ğŸ¦‡ life loss ğŸ¦‡ cancel culture ğŸ¦‡ shaming and silencing culture ğŸ¦‡ addictive tech ğŸ¦‡ addictive porn ğŸ¦‡ lockdowns ğŸ¦‡ loneliness ğŸ¦‡ short attention span ğŸ¦‡ depression ğŸ¦‡ and more ğŸ¦‡

In part, this is how the decade 2020 started for me and my friends.

And for many other people around our planet.

WE MUST CHANGE THE VIBE ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ :heart:

## I Am Terrible At Writing Letters

Hi,

My name is Sumeet Olivier, it used to be Sumeet Pareek, but as a husband I took my wife's lastname and it was quite a thought process - TODO LINK.

I am writing this letter to you, despite being terrible at writting letters, because - TODO MORE CONTEXT HERE.

I suffer from severe ADHD, and for a very very long time now, I have jumped around from working on one idea to the other - TODO.

Maybe it is that I recently got married and feel good about responsibilites (wut!!), or maybe I am adulting again, or maybe I am going through a midlife crisis, or maybe it is just how insane the year 2020 has been â€” but for some reason there is a growing feeling, a realization of sorts that â€” _Us millennials and generation-z folks must now rise to today's challenges, just like the great generations before us had to â€” But differently._

Let us team up and create this thing. Solve a problem. Solve it quick. And change the vibe for rest of the decade 2020.

We are TEAM (( COME UP WITH A COOL NAME LATER )). Our mission is to create the most meaningful Reality TV Show â€” think :heart: vasudhaiva kutumbakam :heart: self-discipline :heart: art and entrepreneurship :heart: compassionate capitalism :heart: coding and open source :heart: america and india :heart: ideas of hindu dharma :heart: church and mosque communities :heart: hard work and house parties :heart: hitchhiking and travel :heart: urban, suburban, and rural america :heart: and more :heart:

# Learn More & Consider Applying

In our show we will â€”

- _build a small team; of young millennials and gen-z folks_
- _build a small business; that helps an individual appreciate their large and diverse family_

(( TODO we do not know how we will do that either ... but time has come for ))
