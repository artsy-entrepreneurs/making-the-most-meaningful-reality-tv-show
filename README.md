# Making The Most Meaningful Reality TV Show

We are TEAM (( COME UP WITH A COOL NAME LATER )). _Our mission is to create the most meaningful Reality TV Show_. Yes, you read that right, and yes, it will not be easy â€” have you seen how _not-effing-real_ all reality tv shows are?!

As we make the most meaningful reality tv show, we will draw inspiration from some select lifestyle aspects of America ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸  and India ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³   bring those aspects together, and do some really awesome shit. Think :heart: / individualism :heart: / family :heart: / balance :heart: / vasudhaiva kutumbakam :heart: / self-discipline :heart: / art :heart: / entrepreneurship :heart: / storytelling :heart: / rural innovation :heart: / urban tools :heart: / hard work :heart: / house parties :heart: / diversity without divide :heart: / inter generational connect :heart: / rural urban travel :heart: /  hitchhiking :heart: / and more :heart: / 

Honestly speaking, at this point (Nov 10, 2020) we DO NOT KNOW how we will make this show, or what it will look like, but we are setting out to make it anyways, because we have a sense of what it will _feel_ like, and because we are driven by the idea that â€”

- _Us young millennials and gen-z folks must rise to today's challenges._ 
- _Just like the great generations before us had to._ 
- _. . . But differently._

ğŸ¦‡ global pandemic ğŸ¦‡ unhealthy globalism ğŸ¦‡ fake news ğŸ¦‡ racial riots ğŸ¦‡ religious riots ğŸ¦‡ job losses ğŸ¦‡ urban divide ğŸ¦‡ rural divide ğŸ¦‡ addictive tech ğŸ¦‡ addictive porn ğŸ¦‡ lockdowns ğŸ¦‡ loneliness ğŸ¦‡ depression ğŸ¦‡ and more. Oh dear God, it will not be easy to overcome how the decade 2020 has started.

But these problems must be sovled, solved quick, and balance restored.
