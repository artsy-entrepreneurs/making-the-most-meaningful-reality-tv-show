I for sure need to change my vibe, for which there is a secret personal reason as well, and so, I am setting out on this journey, a journey of _atleast_ two thousand two hundred and twenty steps, and a simple idea to help with directions — Mission of this journey is to create the most meaningful reality tv show, inspired by the mantra of vasudhaiva kutumbakam, artsy entrepreneurship, and compassionate capitalism 🇮🇳 🇺🇸 ❤️

Allow me to start with an open letter, addressed to yet unknown future applicants, of the most meaningful reality tv show.

## Open Letter To Applicants

Dear applicant,

Hello. Namaste. Trust all is well.

My name is Sumeet Olivier, it used to be Sumeet Pareek, but I recently got married, and as a husband I adopted my wife's lastname as my own. (( TODO what is the connection of that to making the most meaningful reality TV show )) (( TODO blog and/or video link here ))

I am writing this letter to you, despite being terrible at writting letters, because - (( TODO more context here ))

I suffer from severe ADHD, and for a very very long time now, I have jumped around from working on one idea to the other - (( TODO link of all things stated not finished ))

Maybe it is that I recently got married and feel good about responsibilites (wut!!), or maybe I am adulting all over again, or maybe I am going through a midlife crisis, or maybe it is just how insane the year 2020 has been, but for some reason there is this growing feeling — _Us millennials and generation-z folks must now rise to today's challenges — Just like the great generations before us had to — But differently._

(( TODO more context of team here ))

Let us call ourselves TEAM (( COME UP WITH A COOL NAME LATER )). Our mission is to create the most meaningful Reality TV Show, inspired by the mantra of vasudhaiva kutumbakam, entrepreneurship, and compassionate capitalism 🇮🇳 🇺🇸 ❤️

(( todo should these other parts be there )) — think :heart: vasudhaiva kutumbakam :heart: self-discipline :heart: art and entrepreneurship :heart: compassionate capitalism :heart: coding and open source :heart: america and india :heart: ideas of hindu dharma :heart: church and mosque communities :heart: hard work and house parties :heart: hitchhiking and travel :heart: urban, suburban, and rural america :heart: and more :heart:

Let us team up and create this thing. Solve a problem. Solve it quick. And change the vibe for rest of the decade 2020.
