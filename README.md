# Making The Most Meaningful Reality TV Show

ðŸ¦‡ global pandemic ðŸ¦‡ unhealthy globalism ðŸ¦‡ fake news ðŸ¦‡ racial riots ðŸ¦‡ religious riots ðŸ¦‡ urban rural divide ðŸ¦‡ job loss ðŸ¦‡ life loss ðŸ¦‡ cancel culture ðŸ¦‡ shaming and silencing culture ðŸ¦‡ addictive tech ðŸ¦‡ addictive porn ðŸ¦‡ lockdowns ðŸ¦‡ loneliness ðŸ¦‡ short attention span ðŸ¦‡ depression ðŸ¦‡ and more ðŸ¦‡

In part, this is how the decade 2020 started for me and my friends, and many other people around our planet.

Maybe it is the fact that I recently got married, and feel good about responsibilites (wut!!), or maybe I am adulting again, or maybe it is a midlife crisis, or maybe it is just how insane the year 2020 has been â€” but for some reason there is a growing feeling, a realization of sorts that â€” _Us millennials and generation-z folks must now rise to today's challenges, just like the great generations before us had to â€” But differently._

WE MUST CHANGE THE VIBE.

Hi,

My name is Sumeet Olivier, before my wedding it used to be Sumeet Pareek, but as a husband I took my wife's lastname, because this is what my thought process was - TODO LINK.

I am writing this note to - TODO MORE CONTEXT HERE.

I suffer from severe ADHD, and for a very very long time now, I have jumped around from working on one idea to the other - TODO.

Let us team up and create this thing. Solve a problem. Solve it quick. And change the vibe for rest of the decade 2020.

We are TEAM (( COME UP WITH A COOL NAME LATER )). Our mission is to create the most meaningful Reality TV Show â€” think :heart: vasudhaiva kutumbakam :heart: self-discipline :heart: art and entrepreneurship :heart: compassionate capitalism :heart: coding and open source :heart: america and india :heart: ideas of hindu dharma :heart: church and mosque communities :heart: hard work and house parties :heart: hitchhiking and travel :heart: urban, suburban, and rural america :heart: and more :heart:
